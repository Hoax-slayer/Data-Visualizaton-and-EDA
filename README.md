# Data-Visualizaton and EDA Using Python

In this project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Prices for some of the bank stocks using Yahoo Finance data from 2006 - 2016
My focus is on data visualization using Python in order to see how the stocks progressed through the famous financial crisis of 2008.
